<p>This End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is entered into by and between Virto Software Ltd. ("<strong>VIRTO</strong>") for the Virto Commerce product which includes computer software, and may include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT" or "SOFTWARE"), and the Licensee executing the VIRTO Order Form (defined below). The parties agree as follows:</p>

<h4>1. License</h4>

<p>1.1. Subject to Licensee's payment of the applicable fees and to Licensee's compliance with other terms and conditions of this Agreement, VIRTO grants Licensee a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to copy the Software for the purpose of installing and using it on a computer and solely for internal purposes, in accordance with the Software's technical documentation and solely during the periods and on the maximum number of Designated Servers specified in one or more applicable VIRTO or VIRTO-authorized reseller ordering schedules (the "<strong>Virto Commerce Order Form</strong>") executed with Licensee.</p>

<p>1.2. In the event that Licensee's actual number of Servers of a particular Software license exceeds the licensed number of Designated Servers on such license, Licensee shall promptly provide VIRTO with written notice and pay VIRTO the fees required to license such additional Server(s) in accordance with the commercial terms set out in the Virto Commerce Order Form.</p>

<p>1.3. Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum number of licensed Servers of the Software. VIRTO reserves the right to audit Licensee's use of the Software during normal business hours and with reasonable notice and to include means within the Software to limit Licensee's use of the Software to the licensed number of Servers.</p>

<p>1.4. VIRTO shall provide to Licensee an initial copy of the Software, including the associated technical documentation, for use by Licensee in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to Sections 1.1-1.3 above, Licensee is authorized to make a reasonable number of non-Server copies of the Software, e.g., onto a local pc, as it requires for purpose of exercising its rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p>1.5. Licensee is authorized to use the Software on a staging or development Server(s). Licensee may transfer the Software on a permanent basis to a single replacement Server without charge. Licensee agrees to provide VIRTO with written notice, including the Server type and operating system, of any such transfer to a backup or replacement Server within five (5) days thereafter.</p>

<p>1.6. Licensee acknowledges that the Software is also available to the public under VirtoCommerce's open source version of the Software, known as Virto Commerce Community Edition, subject to certain conditions, with limited warranties and other limited assurances, and without service or support. As an express condition for the license granted hereunder, Licensee agrees that any use during the term of this Agreement of such open source versions of the Software in a Production Server Instance shall be deemed use of the Software for purposes of the calculation of fees payable under the Agreement.</p>

<p>1.7. VIRTO also grants Licensee the right to modify and create derivative works of the Software. Licensee may contribute the rights in any of those derivative works back to VIRTO. Licensee may contact VirtoSoftware for more information regarding contributions of derivative works rights to VIRTO. Regardless of whether Licensee contributes such derivative works rights to VIRTO, Licensee hereby grants VIRTO a perpetual and irrevocable (irrespective of the expiration or termination of this Agreement), nonexclusive, transferable, worldwide, and royalty-free license to reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, perform, and display any derivative works of the Software developed by or for Licensee, and to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, export, and otherwise exploit any product based on any such derivative works.</p>

<h4>4. Title and Protection</h4>

<p>4.1. VIRTO (or its third party providers) retains title to all portions of the Software and other Proprietary Materials and any copies thereof. The Proprietary Materials contain valuable proprietary information, and Licensee shall not disclose them to anyone other than those of its employees or consultants under written nondisclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement, having a need to know for purposes consistent with this Agreement. Licensee shall be responsible for the compliance of such employees or consultants. Licensee shall affix, to each full or partial copy of the Software made by Licensee, all copyright and proprietary information notices as were affixed to the original. The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>4.2. Licensee acknowledges that the Software includes certain open source software which is governed by the applicable license terms thereof. A list of such open source software, as amended from time to time, including the links applicable to such open source software is specified in the product software bundled within the Software, and the Software is subject to the provisions of such license agreements, and in the event of any contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of such applicable license agreement, the provisions of the applicable open source license agreement shall prevail solely with respect to such open source software products.</p>

<p>4.3. If the Software is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S. Government (the "<strong>Government</strong>"), the Government agrees that such Product is "commercial computer software" or "commercial computer software documentation" and that, absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Government's rights with respect thereto are limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to applicable FAR and/or DFARS and successor regulations.</p>

<h4>5. Patent and Copyright Indemnity</h4>

<p>Subject to the limitations in Section 8, for such time as Licensee is entitled to receive Support Services (as defined below), VIRTO shall indemnify and defend Licensee against any claims made by a third party that Licensee's reproduction of the Software (which, for the purposes of this Section 5, means the Software as delivered by VIRTO, excluding the open source software programs described in Section 4.2) as permitted in this Agreement directly infringes such third party's United States patent or copyright, provided that Licensee complies with the requirements of this Section. Licensee will (a) provide VIRTO prompt written notice of any claim that the Software infringes any intellectual property rights, (b) provide VIRTO with all information and assistance requested of it with respect to any such claim, and (c) offer VIRTO sole and complete authority to defend and/or settle any and all such claims.</p>

<p>In the event that a court holds that the Software, or if VIRTO believes a court may hold that the Software, infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, VIRTO may (but is not obligated to), in its sole discretion, do any of the following: obtain for Licensee the right to continue using the Software, replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent performance or, accept return of the Software, terminate this Agreement, and refund Licensee an amount equal to the license fees paid to VIRTO multiplied by the percentage of the term of the license for the Software that Licensee did not enjoy due to the early termination by VIRTO.</p>

<p>VIRTO shall have no liability or obligation under this Agreement to the extent the alleged infringement is based on (i) a modification or derivative work of the Software developed by anyone other than VIRTO; (ii), a combination of the Software with any product or service not provided by VIRTO; (iii) use of the Software with one or more Servers not listed in a VIRTO Order Form; (iv) use of the Software other than in accordance with this Agreement or the documentation; (v) indirect or willful infringement; or (vi) any open source code, as described in Section 4.2.</p>

<p>6.2. If an event of default occurs, the non-defaulting party, in addition to any other rights available to it under the law, may terminate this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder by written notice to the defaulting party.</p>

<p>6.3. Within thirty (30) days after termination of the Software license or this Agreement or expiration of the license term as specified in the VIRTO Order Form, Licensee shall certify in writing to VIRTO that Licensee has ceased use of any and all Proprietary Materials and that all copies or embodiments thereof in any form, including partial copies within modified versions, have been destroyed.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a properly submitted Software problem, as specified on the Site, Support Services shall be prioritized in accordance with the guidelines below:</p>

<p>7.1. Priority 1 ("P1") - A P1 is a catastrophic production problem within the Software that severely impacts the Licensee's Production Server Instance, or because of which Licensee's Production Server Instance is down or not functioning, or that results in a loss of production data and no work around exists. P1 problems must be reported on VIRTO's toll-free support telephone number in order to expedite resolution. VIRTO will use continuous efforts 24x7x365, with appropriate escalation to senior management, to provide a resolution for any P1 problem as soon as is commercially reasonable.</p>

<p>7.2. Priority 2 ("P2") - A P2 is a problem within the Software where the Licensee's system is functioning but in a reduced capacity, or the Problem is causing significant impact to portions of the Licensee's business operations and productivity, or the Software is exposed to potential loss or interruption of service. Problems existing in a non-production environment that would otherwise qualify as a P1 if they were in a production system qualify as P2. VIRTO will use efforts during its normal hours of operation, 24 hours a day, (Monday - Friday) to provide a resolution for any P2 problem as soon as is commercially reasonable.</p>

<p>7.3. Priority 3 ("P3") - A P3 is a medium-to-low impact problem that involves partial and/or non-critical loss of functionality, or that impairs some operations but allows Licensee's operations to continue to function. Problems for which there is limited or no loss or functionality or impact to Licensee's operation and for which there is an easy work-around qualify as P3. VIRTO will use reasonable efforts during its normal hours of operation<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">, 24 hours a day, (Monday - Friday)</span> to provide a resolution for any P3 problem in time for the next minor release of the Software.</p>

<p>7.4. Priority 4 ("P4") - A P4 is for a general usage question or issue that may be cosmetic in nature or documentation related, but the Software works without interruption.&nbsp; VIRTO will use efforts during its normal hours of operation<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">, 24 hours a day, (Monday - Friday)</span> to provide a resolution for any P4 problem in time for the next major release of the Software.</p>

<p>7.5. Enhancement Request ("ER") - An ER is a recommendation for future product enhancement or modification to add official support and documentation for an unsupported or undocumented feature, or features that do not exist in the Software. VIRTO will take ERs into consideration in the product management process, but has no obligation to deliver enhancements based on any ER.</p>

<h4>8. Response Times</h4>

<p>VIRTO will provide Support Services and any Updates to Licensee during the periods identified in the Order Form and the default and termination shall be governed by Article 6 of the Agreement. &nbsp;Licensee's obligation of payment of moneys due under these Support Terms shall survive termination of these Support Terms or the Agreement. &nbsp;Licensee acknowledges and agrees that VIRTO shall have the right to terminate the provision of Support Services upon nonpayment of any fees due to VIRTO.</p>
