<h4>2. THE SERVICES</h4>

<p><strong>2.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Statement of Works.</u> Each time Customer wishes to have VIRTO perform Services and deliver Deliverables, the Parties will execute a Statement of Work. All such Statement of Works shall be in writing, and shall be effective only when signed by both Parties.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Changes.</u> Either Party may propose Changes pursuant to Section 2.3; provided that no Change shall be implemented until the Parties have executed a Change Order (as defined below). Once agreed upon by the Parties, Changes shall be implemented in accordance with the terms agreed upon in writing by the Parties in a Change Order, including reasonable pricing adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Change Orders.</u> To request a Change, a Party will deliver a written request (<strong><u>"Change Order Request"</u></strong>) to the other Party specifying (a) the proposed Change and the requested implementation schedule; (b) the objective or purpose of such Change; (c) the requirements and Specifications of any Deliverables to be delivered pursuant to such Change; and (d) the requested prioritization and schedule for such Change. If the Parties agree to proceed with the proposed Change, the Parties must execute a written approval of the proposed Change (<strong><u>"Change Order"</u></strong>). Executed Change Orders shall become part of the Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work, both of which shall be amended thereby.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>2.4.</strong>&nbsp;</span><u>Changes in Law.</u> In the event of any change in Law that requires Changes, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment to the extent required by the applicable Law, and shall, if the Parties so agree, confirm such Changes in a Change Order. In the event that no such agreement is reached within a reasonable period, but not to exceed fifteen (15) days, from a Party's delivery to the other Party of a Charge Order Request in connection with or pursuant to the change in Law, VIRTO shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement with respect to the Statement of Work affected by the change in Law.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>2.5.</strong>&nbsp;</span><u>Service Locations; Equipment.</u> Unless otherwise agreed, VIRTO shall provide the Services on its premises.

Customer shall be responsible for supplying the equipment and other material required to complete the Services in a timely manner (<strong>"Customer Material"</strong>).</p>

<h4>3. DELIVERABLES</h4>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Delivery of Deliverables.</u> Upon completion of a Deliverable, VIRTO shall deliver such Deliverable, in the manner and using a method set out in the applicable Statement of Work, to Customer. A Customer may determine whether a software Deliverable substantially conforms to the applicable Specifications using the acceptance testing procedure set forth below unless other acceptance testing criteria are agreed in the applicable Statement of Work.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>3.2.</strong>&nbsp;</span><u>Acceptance Testing for Software Deliverables.</u> Acceptance by Customer of a software Deliverable shall occur no later than three (3) business days from the date of delivery of the software Deliverable to Customer (<strong>"Acceptance Period"</strong>) upon the earlier of: (i) Customer notifying of its acceptance at any time during the Acceptance Period; (ii) Customer failing to notify of its acceptance or to provide VIRTO with a list of Non-conformities (as defined below) prior to expiration of the Acceptance Period; (iii) successful Acceptance Testing (as described below); or (iv) use by Customer of the software Deliverable other than for Acceptance Testing (collectively, <strong>"Acceptance"</strong>). If Acceptance is not confirmed earlier, Customer shall be entitled, during the Acceptance period, to test the Deliverable to determine whether it substantially conforms to the applicable Specifications in all material respects (<strong>"Acceptance Testing"</strong>). If the Deliverable successfully passes an Acceptance Test, then Customer shall promptly notify VIRTO of its Acceptance. If promptly after Acceptance Testing and within the applicable Acceptance Period, Customer notifies VIRTO in writing of any material non-conformities in a Deliverable as evaluated against the applicable Specifications (each, a <strong>"Non-conformity"</strong>), Customer shall cooperate with VIRTO in identifying in what respect the Deliverable has failed to conform to the Specifications, and grant VIRTO a reasonable time to correct any such Non-conformity. Customer shall have the right to re-test the corrected Deliverable, upon the initial completion of such Deliverable. For removal of doubt, this Section 3.2 shall not apply to a non-software Deliverable.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>3.3.</strong>&nbsp;</span><u>Delays not attributable to VIRTO.</u> Failure to achieve Acceptance according to the Acceptance Testing procedure set out above, due to any reason not attributable to VIRTO shall not delay Acceptance.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>3.4.</strong>&nbsp;</span><u>Minor Deficiencies.</u> The Parties shall mutually agree on a list of any Minor Deficiencies, which shall not affect Acceptance and a fixed time within which such Deficiencies should be remedied. "Minor Deficiencies” refers to issues that do not substantially affect the commercial operation of any Deliverable.</p>

<h4>4. PAYMENT OF FEES</h4>

<p><strong>4.1.&nbsp;</strong><u>Fees.</u> Customer shall pay VIRTO, for the Services and Deliverables provided by VIRTO, the fees as specified in each applicable Statement of Work. The Services may be performed by VIRTO on either a time and materials basis or on a fixed price basis, or a combination thereof, as set forth in the applicable Statement of Work.</p>

<p><strong><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">4.2.&nbsp;</span></strong><u>Payment Terms.</u> Customer shall pay VIRTO within fourteen (14) days of the date of invoice and prior to delivery of the Deliverable, and overdue payments shall bear interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable Law. All payments to VIRTO under the Agreement are exclusive of all current and future taxes, including without limitation, sales, use, value-added, withholding or other taxes or levies on transactions made under the Agreement, excluding taxes based on VIRTO's income. VIRTO shall deliver or otherwise make available the Deliverable to Licensee within two (2) business days from the receipt of payment of the applicable fees.</p>

<p><strong><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">4.3.&nbsp;</span></strong><u>Expenses.</u> In addition to the fees, Customer shall reimburse VIRTO for out-of-pocket travel and other expenses actually incurred by VIRTO in connection with its performance of the Services, provided prior approval to incur such expenses is obtained from Customer. VIRTO will not be responsible for any delay caused by or due to the time required for Customer to provide such approval.</p>

<h4>5. PROPIETARY RIGHTS</h4>

<p><strong>5.1.&nbsp;</strong><u>Proprietary Materials.</u> Customer agrees that the Deliverables, related documentation, manuals and other Proprietary Material provided to Customer hereunder are proprietary information of VIRTO (or its third party providers) and that VIRTO (or its third party providers) shall retain sole and exclusive ownership in and to the Deliverables and all of its other Proprietary Material and to all copies thereof, including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights therein.

A disclosing Party shall be responsible for the compliance of such employees or consultants. Each Party shall, by all appropriate means, use best efforts to prevent unauthorized disclosure, publication, display or use of any Proprietary Material. Each Party shall affix, to each full or partial copy of the other Party's Proprietary Material, all copyright and proprietary information notices as were affixed to the original. Upon written request by a disclosing Party at any time, the other Party shall: (a) turn over to the disclosing Party all Proprietary Material, all documents or media containing the Proprietary Material, and any and all copies or extracts thereof, or (b) destroy the Proprietary Material, and all copies or extracts thereof, and provide the disclosing Party with written certification of such destruction signed by an authorized representative of the other Party.
