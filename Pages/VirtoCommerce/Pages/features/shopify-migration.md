                        Shopify is designed for small businesses and offers a generic one size fits all checkout experience that you can customize using css. 
						However such customizations are only cosmetic and don't offer a way to dramatically improve your customer experience resulting
						in lost opportunities and revenue. With Virto Commerce you'll be able to completely change how customers shop and purchase your products.

					<span class="descr">
                        Want to offer special terms and pricing for your partners and vendors? Want to allow your vendors to have custom stores with their own themes?
