Decisions typically require the integration of multiple people and systems often involving lines of credit, permissions, price lists, contracts, etc. This process can vary greatly from company to company and depends upon the needs specific to the business. Consequently, the solution must be sufficiently flexible such that it enables the company to customize the platform to meet its unique needs. In so doing, the engine must simultaneously integrate people and systems. as well as be equipped with a document based order management module. The Virto Commerce order/checkout engine satisfies all of these specification requirements.
